FIR Filter Analysis:

Filter Type: Low-Pass
Order: 3 (4 taps)

Input: Sample step waveform
Output: Smoothed version of input (transient removed)

Latency: 4 cycles
Arithmetic: Multiplier-heavy, suitable for FPGA DSP blocks

Simulation Result:
- Verified using waveform.vcd in GTKWave
- Output matches expected convolution results

Conclusion:
- The filter meets basic smoothing requirements
- Can be extended to more taps for better roll-off
